# Academic Thesis Template

This is a fork of Ben Swift's [academic LaTeX thesis template](https://github.com/benswift/academic-thesis-template)
for arts and humanities theses and exegeses.

### Example

[This is what the output pdf looks like.](https://github.com/kieranbrowne/academic-thesis-template-chichago/raw/master/thesis.pdf)

### Bibliography

Use the google scholar cite function to export citations in the BibLaTeX 
format and append these to the bibliography file `thesis.bib`

### Compile

To compile the document I recommend you use the `texlive-full` package.
Run using:
```
xelatex thesis
bibtex thesis
xelatex thesis
```
